# React form UI and front-end logic

This is a React UI for a multi-step form. It's available live at https://mkraw.com/react-form/

Data is loaded from an array of objects. 

State is saved and preserved while the modal remains open. Go to [the form online](https://mkraw.com/react-form/), open the form, make a few selections, click Next, and then click Previous. State is preserved while the form is open. 

The form also performs client-side validation of all input elements, and demonstrates phone formatting.
